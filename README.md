## About

The main goal of this dataset is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not, based on their historical data. This dataset is often used to showcase the various features and capabilities of PyCaret, including data preprocessing, model training and selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model interpretation.


## Creating a machine learning pipeline with Pycaret
I will be exploring the following steps to achieve a ML_pipeline using pycaret:

ðŸ’¡ Set up the environment, Get dataset and Check for nulls

ðŸ’¡ Compare Models

ðŸ’¡ Create the Model

ðŸ’¡ Tune the Model

ðŸ’¡ Plot the Model

ðŸ’¡ Evaluate the model

ðŸ’¡ Finalize the Model

ðŸ’¡ Predict with the model

ðŸ’¡ Save/Load Model

## Things to Note
To be able to run this analysis, you will need the following:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Pycaret 3.0
- Python 3.x


## Installation
To install Pycaret 3.0, run the following command:

```bash python
!pip install pycaret[full]
```
-------

## Dataset
The dataset used was imported from pycaret using the code below

```bash python
from pycaret.classification import *
from pycaret.datasets import get_data
dataset = get_data('bank')
```
